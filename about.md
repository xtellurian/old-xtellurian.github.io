Hey, my name's Rian and this is my blog. I'm an engineer, developer, and scientist. I'm interested in robots, communication, materials, IoT, kick-ass software, and empowerment through collaboration.

You can see my resume [here]({{ site.url }}/resume.html)

I'm good at abstraction, prediction, design, logic, and agility.

This blog was made using Jekyll. I built it  built for kicks. It has no practical purpose.
Go in peace.
