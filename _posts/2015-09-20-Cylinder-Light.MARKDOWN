Want to make your own custom dynamic LED light?
## Ingredients:

* LEDs. As always, NeoPixels are the tri-colour LED of choice, due to their simple single-wire serial, and excellent choice of form-factors. I've used Sparkfun's [Flexible LED array](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/13304) because of its LED density, and the cool flexible PCB means I can easily make a cylindrical array.
* Arduino. I used an Uno for development, because its so easy to work with, but I'll me moving to a Pro-Micro for the final product, because its much smaller and can be hidden away inside the light.
* Outer Shell. Your going to need something to diffuse the light coming from your LEDs because point-sources suck! If you want to bust out, I recommend a nice piece of diffusing acrylic. It can get a little expensive if you can't find something second hand, but who say's the aesthetic is cheap?
* Inner shell/ frame. If you're using a flexible LED strip or matrix, then consider using a piece of PCV tubing for the internal structure. Otherwise, you could make do with wooden dowel or even one large piece of pine/ light timber.
* Outer Frame. To pull your light together, you're going to need some nice pieces of material to finish it off. I'm going to finish mine with some hardwood, but you could use ply, or even try and use polished metal or plastic if you're feeling it.
